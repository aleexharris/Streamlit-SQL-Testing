Attempting to recreate the basic functionality of Dune in streamlit.

## TODO:
- [ ] Implement the background job and email .csv functionality
- [ ] Add a "schemas" page that shows all tables and views in the database
- [ ] Add some preset visualisations for data (eg. timeseries line chart, pie chart, etc.)
